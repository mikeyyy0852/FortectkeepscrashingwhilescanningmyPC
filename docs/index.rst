Introduction
============

Fortect is a Windows repair and optimization application that helps identify system problems, damaged files, registry issues, and performance-related errors. While scanning a computer, Fortect analyzes many parts of the operating system, which requires access to system files, settings, and background processes.

Some users may experience a problem where **Fortect keeps crashing while scanning the PC**. The scan may stop at a certain percentage, the application may close unexpectedly, freeze, or display an error message.

This problem is commonly caused by corrupted application files, Windows system errors, outdated software, insufficient permissions, antivirus conflicts, or damaged files that Fortect is attempting to analyze.

This guide explains the common causes of Fortect scan crashes and provides effective solutions to fix the problem.

Why Fortect Crashes During a Scan
=================================

Fortect may crash while scanning because of:

* Corrupted Fortect installation files
* Outdated Fortect version
* Damaged Windows system files
* Lack of administrator permissions
* Conflicts with antivirus software
* Insufficient memory or disk space
* Problems with Windows services
* Malware interference
* Corrupted registry entries
* Other background applications causing conflicts

Understanding the cause helps you choose the correct troubleshooting method.

Restart Your Computer
=====================

A simple restart can resolve temporary problems that cause Fortect to crash during scanning.

Restarting Windows helps:

* Close unnecessary background processes
* Refresh system resources
* Clear temporary errors
* Restart Windows services

After restarting, open Fortect again and run the scan.

Run Fortect as Administrator
============================

Fortect requires elevated permissions to access and repair protected Windows components.

To run Fortect with administrator privileges:

1. Close Fortect.
2. Right-click the Fortect shortcut.
3. Select **Run as administrator**.
4. Start the scan again.

Running the application with full permissions can prevent crashes caused by restricted access.

Update Fortect
==============

An outdated Fortect version may contain bugs or compatibility problems that cause scanning failures.

To update Fortect:

1. Open Fortect.
2. Check for available updates.
3. Install the latest version.
4. Restart the application.

If Fortect crashes immediately, download and install the newest version from the official source.

Check Windows Updates
=====================

Windows updates often include fixes for system components used by repair applications.

To update Windows:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Select **Windows Update**.
3. Click **Check for updates**.
4. Install available updates.
5. Restart your computer.

After updating Windows, run the Fortect scan again.

Close Background Applications
=============================

Other applications may interfere with Fortect while it scans system files.

Before scanning:

* Close web browsers.
* Exit unnecessary applications.
* Stop heavy background programs.
* Disable resource-intensive tasks temporarily.

Freeing system resources can prevent crashes during long scans.

Disable Antivirus Temporarily
=============================

Security software may block Fortect when it accesses system files or registry locations.

Temporarily disable:

* Third-party antivirus programs
* Firewall software
* Internet security applications

Then run the Fortect scan again.

If the scan completes successfully, add Fortect as an exception in your antivirus settings.

Check Available Disk Space and Memory
=====================================

Fortect requires enough storage and memory to complete system scans.

Check:

* Available space on the Windows drive.
* Current RAM usage.
* Running background applications.

To improve performance:

* Delete temporary files.
* Close unnecessary programs.
* Restart Windows before scanning.

Repair Fortect Installation
===========================

Corrupted Fortect files may cause crashes during scanning.

To repair or reinstall:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Go to **Apps > Installed Apps**.
3. Select Fortect.
4. Uninstall the application.
5. Restart your computer.
6. Install the latest Fortect version.

A clean installation replaces damaged files and restores missing components.

Run System File Checker
=======================

Damaged Windows system files can cause repair tools to crash.

To check and repair Windows files:

1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
2. Run:

::

   sfc /scannow

3. Wait until the scan completes.
4. Restart your PC.

System File Checker repairs corrupted Windows files that may affect Fortect.

Run DISM Repair Tool
====================

If SFC cannot repair all system issues, use DISM.

Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:

::

   DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

Allow the repair process to finish.

Restart Windows and run Fortect again.

Perform a Clean Boot
====================

Startup applications and third-party services can interfere with Fortect scans.

A Clean Boot starts Windows with only essential services.

Steps:

1. Press **Windows + R**.
2. Type::

      msconfig

3. Open the **Services** tab.
4. Select **Hide all Microsoft services**.
5. Disable remaining services.
6. Restart the computer.

Run Fortect after the Clean Boot.

If the scan works, another program is likely causing the conflict.

Scan Your PC for Malware
========================

Malware can interfere with system repair applications and cause unexpected crashes.

Run a security scan using:

* Microsoft Defender Full Scan
* Microsoft Defender Offline Scan
* Another trusted malware scanner

Remove detected threats and restart your computer.

Check Event Viewer Logs
=======================

Windows Event Viewer can provide details about why Fortect crashes.

To check error logs:

1. Press **Windows + R**.
2. Type::

      eventvwr

3. Open:

::

   Windows Logs > Application

4. Find recent Fortect-related errors.

The error details may reveal whether the crash is caused by missing files, permissions, or another application.

Create a New Windows User Account
=================================

A damaged Windows user profile may cause applications to crash.

Create a new administrator account:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Select **Accounts**.
3. Add a new user.
4. Assign administrator rights.
5. Sign in with the new account.
6. Run Fortect.

If Fortect works correctly, the original Windows profile may be damaged.

==================================

Users may experience:

* Fortect closes during scanning
* Scan freezes at a specific percentage
* Fortect stops responding
* Computer slows down during the scan
* Error messages appear during repairs
* Fortect crashes before completing analysis

These issues are usually caused by software conflicts, damaged files, or system resource problems.

When to Contact Fortect Support

* Fortect version
* Crash details
* Error messages
* Scan percentage where the crash occurs

Regular maintenance helps Fortect complete scans smoothly and improves overall Windows performance.

Conclusion
==========

Fortect crashing while scanning your PC is usually caused by outdated software, corrupted installation files, Windows system problems, antivirus conflicts, or insufficient system resources. Running Fortect as an administrator, updating Windows, repairing system files with **SFC** and **DISM**, disabling conflicting software, and reinstalling Fortect can resolve most scanning crashes.

If the issue continues, checking Event Viewer logs, performing a Clean Boot, or testing Fortect from a new Windows user account can help identify deeper problems. Keeping your system updated and maintaining healthy Windows files will help Fortect perform reliable scans and repairs.
